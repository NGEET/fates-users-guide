Welcome to the FATES Users Guide
===================================

**FATES** (Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator) is a numerical terrestrial ecosystem model. Its development and support is primarily supported by the Department of Energy's Office of Science, through the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment - Tropics (NGEE-T) project.

Documentation structure
----------------------- 

This document is structured in four parts:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   tutorial/tutorials
   user/users-guide
   developer/developer-guide
   :doc:`fates-doc`
   
The tutorial will help the new user's and developers orient themselves to fates.  The user's guide is concerned with providing researchers with information on running the FATES model.  The developer's guide focuses on helping researchers and engineers contribute to the FATES model code.  Both the user and developer guide sections follow a common structure comprised of three sub-sections: 

- How-to: Straight forward recipes for common tasks
- Overview: Narrative discussions of the concepts
- Reference: Description of specific code procedures and routines

This structure adapts the `Divio documentation framework`_.

Technical Documentation
-----------------------

The :doc:`FATES technical document <fates-doc:index>` details the scientific underpinning of the model is hosted as a Read The Docs :doc:`rtd:subprojects` within this User's Guide.  As a subproject both the guide and the techincal documentation are searchable through the index in this User's Guide.
