FATES Tutorials
=========

The tutorial section is separated into two different options that are based upon which class of machine the user will be interfacing with FATES.  The :doc:`Containerized Tutorial <fates-tutorial:index>` is intended for users that would like to deploy fates on their local laptop or workstatoin.  The :ref:`HPC/hpc` tutorial is intended for users with access to a cluster or supercomputer and assumes that the host land model is already supported to some degree.
