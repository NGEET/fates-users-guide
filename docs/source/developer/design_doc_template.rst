Design Document Template
========================

Introduction
------------
.. Discuss the design origins, intent and goals.  What is the problem statement?  If there are any specification documents, link them in Appendix.

Design Considerations
---------------------
.. Describe the issues that need to be addressed before creating a design solution.

Assumptions and Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. Describe any assumptions that may be wrong or any dependencies on other things

General Constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. Describe any constraints that could have an impact on the design of the software.

Solutions
---------
.. Section should include alternative implementations/solutions.  Is it feasible? How much effort does it need for each approach? Pros/cons of each approach.  Document alternatives, why you made the decision and how it will affect the team and project.

Design and Architecture
-----------------------
..  Provide a general overview of the software layout

System diagram or flowchart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. Interaction diagram of various inputs, outputs, sub systems and dependencies.


Algorithm or Pseudo code for main components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. Describe your logic in this section.  See https://pypi.org/project/sphinxcontrib-pseudocode/ for links to documentation.

.. pcode::
  
  \begin{algorithm}
  \caption{psedo code}
  \begin{algorithmic}
  \PROCEDURE{MyProcedure}{}
  \ENDPROCEDURE
  \end{algorithmic}
  \end{algorithm}

Rollout Plan
------------
.. Define the roll-out phases and tests you plan to do

Future Update Plan
------------------
.. Sketch out future updates if known

Implementation Notes and Lessons Learned
----------------------------------------
.. Optional section summarizing lessons learned after the design has been successfully implemented

Appendix
--------
.. References, links to additional documentation
