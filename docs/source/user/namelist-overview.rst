================

.. note::

   This documentation is currently under development.

This subsection presents information relating to the initialization and run mode options that controlled by the Host Land Model namelist.  Note that the namelist handles mode options that are global in scope to FATES.  FATES does provide PFT-specific mode options that are controlled by the FATES parameter file.  Please refer to the :doc:`Parameter-File` page for more information.

For a summary table of all current FATES options organized by model component please see the following page:
